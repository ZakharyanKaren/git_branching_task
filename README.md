Write a function that makes the first number as large as possible by
swapping out its digits for digits in the second number.

example:

maxPossible(1234, 567) -> 7654
7654 is the largest possible number built from swaps from 567.
1 replaced with 7, 2 replaced with 6 and 3 replaced with 5
.
maxPossible(523, 76) - 763
maxPossible(9132, 5564) - 9655
maxPossible(8732, 91255) - 9755
